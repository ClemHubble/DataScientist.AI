# Introduction
This platform provides a simple and intuitive way to upload datasets, select target variables, train machine learning models, and evaluate their performance. The platform supports both classification and regression problems and provides a range of metrics for model evaluation.

# Features
Dataset Upload: Upload your dataset in CSV format.

Dataset Summary: Get an AI-generated overview of your input dataset.

Interact With Platform: Ask any questions about your dataset.

Target Variable Selection: Select the target variable for your machine learning problem.

Feature Engineering: Get an AI-generated feature engineering suggestion.

Model Selection: Platform automatically chooses from a range of algorithms for classification and regression problems.

Model Training: Train your selected model on the uploaded dataset.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of your trained model using various metrics.

Confusion Matrix: Display a confusion matrix for classification problems.

Model Interpretation: Get an AI-generated explanation of your model's performance.

Chat History: Keeps a record of user conversations.

Model History: Keeps a record of past trained and evaluated models.
